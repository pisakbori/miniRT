-good looking images for each eval sheet point
-separate bonus from mandatory (also specular)
-test all possible wrong inputs (make a collection of everything that can go wrong)
-check leaks again to be 10000000% sure
-if any other than  C L sp etc then ERROR
-if BONUS 0 only 1 L
- when parsing colors, atoi, value must be >=0 and <=255
- positive reads diameter etc.
check in parsing which ones have to be normalized and which not
- check get length function as to be normalized and have 1
- there should be at least 1 camera check sheet !
